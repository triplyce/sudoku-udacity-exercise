# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: The technique used here searches for all possible naked twins and eliminates these values from their respective units.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: Increasing the number of constraints facilitates problem resolution. Here we just add the diagonals to the list of units. So whenever there are changes the constraints will be propagated.
